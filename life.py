"""Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life
Somewhat inspired by Jack Diederich's talk `Stop Writing Classes`
http://pyvideo.org/video/880/stop-writing-classes
Ironically, as I extended the functionality of this module it seems obvious
that the next step would be to refactor board into a class with advance and
constrain as methods and print_board as __str__.
